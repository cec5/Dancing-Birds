It breeds in the arid, semi-arid and Mediterranean climate zones of the Southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico, mainly in Southern California and the Baja California Peninsula. Like many hummingbirds in the region, it can be found on the Pacific coast, often visiting backyard hummingbird feeders and gardens with flowering plants, as well as in more wild ecosystems, such as the conifer and oak forests, chaparral, and high desert habitats found further inland. When not in the US, the species often winters in western Mexico.','https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2a/Hummingbird.jpg/800px-Hummingbird.jpg','https://www.youtube.com/embed/scCZ8aoq_sA?si=BbEfKPkfPJklFXYn','2025-05-13 18:56:56'),(2,'Indian Peafowl','Pavo Cristatus','An unmistakable, large ground bird. The unmistakable iridescent blue male spreads out its ornamental upper tail feathers when courting females. Females have a shorter tail, an iridescent green neck, and browner plumage. Found in forest, forest edge, and agricultural land. Often seen on paths or alertly feeding in the undergrowth. Can be fairly confiding especially when found close to human habitation. Its loud screaming “may-yow” calls are heard incessantly during the rainy season.','https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c5/Peacock_Plumage.jpg','https://www.youtube.com/embed/TTwT1-TpFhE?si=AgQUA2dwei-H2w7e','2025-05-13 21:27:02'),(3,'Blue-Footed Booby','Sula Nebouxii','The blue-footed booby is a marine bird native to subtropical and tropical regions of the eastern Pacific Ocean. It is one of six species of the genus Sula – known as boobies. It is easily recognizable by its distinctive bright blue feet, which is a sexually selected trait and a product of their diet. Males display their feet in an elaborate mating ritual by lifting them up and down while strutting before the female. The female is slightly larger than the male and can measure up to 90 cm (35 in) long with a wingspan up to 1.5 m (5 ft).','https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Blue-footed-booby.jpg/800px-Blue-footed-booby.jpg','https://www.youtube.com/embed/lcPHFQP9GN0?si=Vg1UyMcDPhs_IAAo','2025-05-13 21:32:28'),(4,'Red-Capped Manakin','Ceratopipra Mentalis','The red-capped manakin is a species of bird in the family Pipridae.
